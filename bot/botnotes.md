what does the bot need to do?:

- countdown 30 minutes in the background and announce on discord if 30 minutes had passed (pizza is then free)
- send the "customer" (the chat) a pdf containing the bill/reciept with the food + the cost of everything + the customer's details
- a command in discord to check how much time till the delivery is coming
